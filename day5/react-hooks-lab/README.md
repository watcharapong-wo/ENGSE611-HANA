# React Hooks Lab — Completed Solution

This matches the lab you shared (useState, useEffect, cleanup, and debounced search), plus a bonus Todo List challenge.

## How to run (Create React App)

```bash
npx create-react-app react-hooks-lab
cd react-hooks-lab
# Replace the generated src and public with the ones in this zip
# - copy the /src and /public folders into your CRA project
npm start
```

Or use Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest react-hooks-lab -- --template react
cd react-hooks-lab
npm install
# copy the /src content into the vite /src; keep vite's index.html
npm run dev
```
